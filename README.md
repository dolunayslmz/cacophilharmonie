# cacophilharmonie
Cacophilharmonie AM-1in is an interactive kinetic sound installation using spring-steel sheets, stepper and DC motors, and an Arduino-based control system. This repository contains the Arduino code, motor-driver configurations, wiring diagrams, and implementation notes used to activate the metal sheets through vibration and mechanical excitation.
